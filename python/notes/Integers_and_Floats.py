# HG Integers and Floats Notes
price = float(input("How much is your item: $"))

tax_rate = float(input("what percent is the tax?: %"))/100

total = price * (1 + tax_rate)


print(round(total, 2))


# next practice:

apples = int(input("How many apples do you have?"))

friends = int(input("How many apples do you have? "))

print("Each friend gets ", apples//friends, " and I have ", apples%friends, " left over.")
